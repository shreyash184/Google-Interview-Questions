Given a binary search tree and a pointer to a node within the binary search tree, return the next smallest and next largest value.

Example1 : Node 15
    15
           /   \
         12  20
Output : next smallest is 12 and next largest is 20

Example2 : Node 10
    10
       \
         15
                   /   \
               12  20
Output : next smallest is 10 and next largest is 12

Example3 : Node 5
        10
               /        \
             5          15
          /    \         /    \
         2    7     12    20
Output : next smallest is 2 and next largest is 7
