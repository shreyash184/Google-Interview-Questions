// First round 

In a city, there is a footpath constructed using blocks of different colors. There can be contiguous blocks of same color as well which makes the footpath beautiful
A chief guest is going to visit the city and the city department wants to make the most beautiful footpath. Beauty value of the footpath is the largest number of continuous blocks painted with chief guest's favorite color.
You are given a positive number n (number of blocks in footpath) and number k (number of available colors for blocks). 
Each block can be painted with exactly one of the given colors (block_colors [1-1] is the color value of ith block, i starting Chief guest's favorite color is c (1 <= c <= k).
Warm-up question: Find the beauty value of the footpath. 18 Example: n=10 k=6 block_colors= (6, 5, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2) c-2 In this case, the beauty value is 2.

FOLLOWUP: queries ka array c_q = [2,3,6,1, 7] 

Followup :  
m is given maximum paint operation with favorite color c that you can do blockcolors.

the operation should be in a way to maximise the length of continous blocks or beautiful path for the color c

// Screening round
Binary tree left most element and right most element which is just greater than a given element

Given a binary search tree and a pointer to a node within the binary search tree, return the next smallest and next largest value.

Example1 : Node 15
    15
           /   \
         12  20
Output : next smallest is 12 and next largest is 20

Example2 : Node 10
    10
       \
         15
                   /   \
               12  20
Output : next smallest is 10 and next largest is 12

Example3 : Node 5
        10
               /        \
             5          15
          /    \         /    \
         2    7     12    20
Output : next smallest is 2 and next largest is 7

Table tennis club takes reservation. Each reservation is for a single table and has start time and end time. In the morning (when all reservations are known) the club needs to setup their gym. They want to set enough tables to satisfy all the reservations.
Design an algorithm and write the program to 
Determine the minimum number of table needed and
To assign each reservation to a table.

Example : 
Timings : [1,4] [2,3] [5,9]
Output : Minimum tables required are 2.
Player 1 can occupy Table No 1
Player 2 can occupy Table No 2
Player 3 can occupy Table No 2, by the time player 3 reaches, 2nd table will be empty.

Follow up : What if the end time and start time of the player can be at a point, how will your code will change and what modifications can be done.

Given a sequence S of N digits, find a subsequence of K digits such that the number formed by these K digits (in order) is the largest.

Examples : 
S = 4902     K = 1        answer = 9
S = 4902     K = 2        answer = 92
S = 4902     K = 3        answer = 902
S = 4902    K = 4        answer = 4902

S = 142857    K = 1        answer = 8
S = 142857     K = 2         answer = 87
S = 142857    K = 3         answer = 857
S = 142857    K = 4        answer = 4857
S = 142857    K = 5        answer = 42857
S = 142857    K = 6        answer = 142857

Follow up : Now for each length from 1 to N, find which index (0 indexing)  will be taken from the original string in the Kth iteration, where K lies between 1 to N.

Example : 
S = 142857    K = 1        answer = 3
S = 142857     K = 2         answer = 5
S = 142857    K = 3         answer = 4
S = 142857    K = 4        answer = 1
S = 142857    K = 5        answer = 2
S = 142857    K = 6        answer = 0

Note : Interviewer was expecting the most efficient solution which is in linear time.

Warmup question : 
Find the weighted Average of the given list of 
[ [3,2] [1.7,4] [5,5] ]
The given list can be represented as  3,3 ,1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 5,5,5,5,5
Now we need to find the average of the above array

Follow up Question : Extension to the warm up question
There is a network of machines, each machine contains a set of data which contains the list and each machine is connected with the different machines and that data is stored in the Connection class, there can be multiple connections, self connection too. There is no such thing as unique id of the each machine.

Find the Weighted average of all the network when you can only invoke weightedAverage method once in one of the machines.

class Machine
{


public:
    // Add whatever is required according to the algorithm
    double weightedAverage()
    {
    }


private:
    vector<pair<double, int>> input_data;
    vector<unique_ptr<Connection>> neighbors
};


class Connection
{
public:
    virtual ~Connection();
    // Add whatever is required according to the algorithm
};

1. Imagine a situation where you are in a team where all the colleagues are not bonding together and what will you do to make the situation better?
Follow up : What if you are the Team Lead of that team?
2. Imagine a situation where you had to complete the tasks compulsory, the deadline is strict, so how do you approach this situation?
3. Suppose you are a product manager and have designed a product and got all the approvals required to start the project, But one fine day you discuss this thing with your friend and he suggests something and it's a really helpful suggestion, what do you do now?
4. What is the biggest hurdle you have come across in your life? And why that particular situation is the biggest hurdle, how did it affect your life?
5. How do you plan your tasks if suppose the deadline is stricter and you definitely need to complete those tasks at any cost?
Note : Each questions can be countered with the answer you will be framing, Interviewer are chill and it will be mostly a discussion.
