You are given an array of coordinates, find if any four of the coordinates can form rectangle. We should return the maxArea formed by the largest rectangle that is possible.
Example : Input :- coordinates = [[2,1],[8,1],[2,-2],[2,4],[8,4],[4,-2],[8,2],[4,1],[9,5],[5,4]]
From the above input , the coordinates that form rectangle are {[2,1],[8,1],[2,4],[8,4]} whose area is 18 and another rectangle possible is {[2,1],[4,1],[2,-2],[4,-2]} whose area is 6.
So the largest rectangle's area is 18 which is the output.

[2, 1]
